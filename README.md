## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sambriggs262/mlproject.git
   cd mlproject
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
mlproject/
├── main.py              # Entry point for CLI usage
├── ml_utils.py          # Core ML functions and helpers
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
├── .gitignore           # Clean version control
├── README.md            # You're here
└── .github/workflows/   # GitHub Actions workflows
```

> Note: Planned refactor will split logic into modules like `data_processing.py`, `model.py`, and `evaluation.py`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Testing is planned using `pytest`. Once tests are added, they will be automatically triggered by the CI pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/`.

---

## ✅ To Do

- [ ] Add modular structure (`/mlproject/` directory)
- [ ] Add docstrings and inline comments
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI
- [ ] Improve dependency management
